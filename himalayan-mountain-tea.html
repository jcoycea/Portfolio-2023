            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Overview</span>This project was a collaboration between TEALEAVES and Tergar Charity Nepal, with the goal of improving the livelihood of the women in Samagaun, a remote Himalayan community.</p>
            <p>We were tasked with creating a tea with wild grown Himalayan gob-chi berries, which are tended and hand-picked by the women of Samagaun, and establishing it as a luxury international product by branding it with the compelling story of the women who harvest them. The profits of this project would go back to the women to help them grow their infrastructure and cultivate their land for more prosperous harvests to come.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Process</span>When we were working on the product packaging, we aimed to think of them as precious gifts of Art & Beauty to be shared with the world. Our intention was to create a unique unboxing experience that would “surprise and delight” our consumers, and to brand this tea as a luxury item with an elegant aesthetic.</p>
            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Packaging</span>The diecut shape of the bottom origami insert is inspired by camellia sinensis flower petals, referencing the tea plant.</p>
            <p>The ridged top (black with gold foiling) is designed to encapsulate the unfolding insert to create a ritualistic unboxing experience, revealing the monolithic black tin on the inside, which then houses the fragrant gob-chi berry loose leaf tea blend. Using the format of this miniature origami-inspired folding box, we crafted some potential designs for the inner graphics.</p>
            <p>The gob-chi tea is held in an unassuming minimalist exterior, void of any excess information. With that said, we wanted the feeling of opening the box to be optimistic and vibrant to allude to women empowerment.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Graphics</span>The box opens up to reveal a striking image of a sunset in the Himalayas. Playing with layering and duotone, the bright effervescent pink sky is punctuated by the striking silhouetted landscape of the Himalayan mountains. Information related to the wild-grown gob-chis and the story of the women who harvest them is also added to give context.</p>
            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Colour Palette</span>The range of colours on the insert creates a stark contrast to the black cylindrical tin found on the inside. When folded, we also liked the idea of the top half of the box being fairly high contrast against the low-contrast bottom graphic.</p>
