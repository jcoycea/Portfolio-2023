            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Overview</span> A collaboration between Pantone Color Institute and TEALEAVES in support of United Nations Biodiversity and World Biodiversity Forum. Pantone Color Institute developed a color inspired by the oldest pigment on Earth: a vibrant pink. The Color of Biodiversity is used as an amplifier and educational tool and has helped to share the future plan for healing and protecting nature in the 2022 UN Biodiversity conference COP15.</p>
            <p>I had the amazing opportunity to conceptualize and design an original graphic for the Color of Biodiversity, including the primary hero image and other marketing collateral, as well as extend the visual identity to the packaging for the Color of Biodiversity tea.</p>

            <p>The magnification of the dissected layers are an attempt to add history to the origin of life by showing evolution - fossils at the bottom transitioning to rocky landforms, lichen, trees, people and other creatures towards the top. The undulating patterns and textures are enhanced by the graininess and organic shapes of the graphic elements.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Colour Palette</span>Aside from the prominent use of the Color of Biodiversity pink hue, some of the colours in the palette are influenced by the palette of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
            <p>It was also intentional that the layers the artwork begin and end with the Color of Biodiversity colour to give reference to it being an ancient colour used to bring attention to biodiversity loss in modern times.</p>
            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Design Decisions</span>Overall, the intention was to maintain a lively tone with the artwork, to imbue the work with optimism for the future, and to keep the mood uplifting and energizing instead of bleak and cynical.</p>
            <p>To give it a sense of playfulness and whimsy, we included minuscule details for the viewer to localize in the different “ecosystems”. We incorporated human and animal silhouettes throughout the artwork to allude to humanity, and good health and growth of living beings. We hope to symbolize the variety of species and interconnected ecosystems that give the Earth its brilliance.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Takeaway</span>It was an incredible honour to have the opportunity to work on this social impact project with Pantone Color Institute and United Nations Biodiversity at this point in my design career. It was such a team effort to put together this campaign and very proud of the team and the outcome.</p>
            <p>I think it will be exciting to see the richness of how the application of the Color of Biodiversity can be used, and how it can be used to spark discussion and new ideas in the community. It has been interesting to see how people have connected and related to the Color.</p>
