            <p>Ebb & Flow Resort 2020/21 is designed for the mindful traveller, looking to explore the notion of storytelling through connecting with culture, community and the environment. Radically emphasizing the relational resources of the land, each piece of the collection is created to capture the neutral, natural and playful side of nature.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Process</span>I was brought on as the graphic designer for the collection and was tasked with developing the overall graphic identity and helping with content creation. Prior to my joining, Charlene had created a visual moodboard for her collection’s fashion pieces and rough colour palette. Collaborating closely with Charlene and working under her vision, I contributed to this moodboard by looking into different graphic design examples for a variety of printed and marketing assets.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the collection’s slow craft ethos and organic artistry, I aimed to define the graphic identity with a sense of timelessness and admiration of the natural world. The earthy tones of the colour palette are directly inspired by the natural dyes hand-painted on the Wabi Wrap and other dyed pieces from the collection. The typographically-led identity and visual communication take aesthetic cues from independent luxury fashion houses. There is a prominent use of negative space and framing to create airiness and aids a viewer in focusing on the main subject.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Typography</span>Bookmania was chosen as the primary typeface and is a digital revival of the Bookman Transitional serif typefaces of the twentieth century, known for its ornate swashes and characters. Capturing a vintage feeling in a modern rendition, the choice of Bookmania exudes an amicable tone, while simultaneously appearing intricate and refined. Used in lowercase for the collection’s logo mark, it has a sense of understated sophistication.</p>

            <p>It is further accompanied by the minimal character of Neue Haas Grotesk, a clean Grotesque sans serif with Swiss Heritage that lends to the elegant nature and enhances legibility.</p>

            <p><span class="content-subtitle">Final Product</span>Further to developing the collection logo mark, I created the editorial design for the Resort 20/21 lookbook, and worked on the graphic design for various collateral including social assets, postcards, and typography on the final collection video.</p>
            <p>The typography and the grounded colour scheme communicate the contemporary nature of the collection and contribute to a look that is meant to embrace the test of time, prolonging its enduring quality. For the visuals of the key looks in the lookbook, I wanted to use photo collages to be able to showcase the main subject and also highlight some of the unique details and features that Charlene had incorporated into her fashion pieces.</p>
            <p>The core of the overall visual language is inspired by the tactility and material attributes of the physical fashion pieces; I also wanted this to extend to the final lookbook and used saddle stitch bookbinding to further communicate the idea of slow living and craftsmanship.</p>
